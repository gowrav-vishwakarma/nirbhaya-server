I am about to discuss my vision with you and looking to have some suggestions.. think like a Vue3 setup typescript nestjs sequelize mysql8 Quasar2 capacitor6 expert.

I have a vision to create a community, I have given it a name "SOS Bharat" . The idea of community to bring tech and non-tech people together. and create a framework where we encourage public to contribute towards solution of common problems. I want them to unite, at least meet and discuss. The idea is to make them loyal to community as well. almost like sleeper cells. But this is a long shot idea.

Also as an example we are giving them how to think and also to have som solid product in hand for going in market and for funding and financials, we are making one app that we are mimicking to be ideated, discussed and made by community.

It’s “SOS Bharat” app with following ideas implemented:

1. It has SOS section where people will register and add their emergency contacts, and also can be volunteer at multiple places by lat/long.. now whenever some one will press SOS button on this app, the emergency contacts and nearby volunteers will get notified, they can follow to destination and even can listen audio broadcasted from sos app.
2. To make this app daily openable, we have added news shorts to the app from Indian and International and various topics.
3. To do more engagement in this app, we have added special social community app like Facebook but with some unique thing. 3.1: When posting we will share location of user (either one of their volunteering location or current location) 3.2: we show nearest posts in users feed to let them connect in their local environment. This aligns with our mission to strengthen the local bond of people.3.3: To make things more authentic, and nuisance free, we are adding some restrictions like no of post anyone can do is limited (though customisable for each user may it be ambassador or some special post in community) and we give them daily x no of likes so they like what really deserve a like.3.4: This will allow shop keepers, small house based business owners to market tin hyper local platform to get their product discover. (We will add e-commerce style later)
   So we will keep this app in front to our social cause and will reach out. We have a few interns and a few developers as core of team.

The app is made in Vue3 and Quasar2 framework with capacitor 6 to make iOS and android app also. The backend is in NestJS, with sequelize typescript form with mysql 8 as database.Now based on this information answer me for asked questions.
